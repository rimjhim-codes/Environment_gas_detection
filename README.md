# 🔍 Air Quality Monitoring & Alert System (Arduino + Android - Java)

This project is a smart IoT-based Android application developed using **Java** that monitors the concentration of harmful gases in the air using sensors connected to an **Arduino**. The app communicates with the Arduino via **Bluetooth** and sends **SMS alerts** with the user's current **GPS location** when gas levels exceed a safe threshold.

## 📱 Features

- 📡 Real-time gas monitoring using MQ-series sensors (e.g., MQ-2, MQ-7)
- 🔗 Bluetooth communication with Arduino via HC-05/HC-06 module
- 🚨 Auto SMS alerts to a predefined contact when gas index exceeds safety limits
- 📍 GPS integration to send real-time location with alert
- 📊 Simple and user-friendly interface
- 🔒 Emergency contact setup within the app

## 🔗 How It Works

1. **Arduino Setup:**
   - MQ sensors detect gas concentration in the environment.
   - Data is sent via the HC-05 Bluetooth module.

2. **Android App:**
   - Receives data from Arduino over Bluetooth.
   - Displays real-time gas index.
   - Sends an SMS with the gas index and current GPS location if the level exceeds the danger threshold.
